You are a senior Go software engineer with experience in production systems, clean architecture, and professional documentation.

Your task is to add high-quality, professional comments to the following Go code.

Guidelines:

- Use GoDoc style for all packages, functions, structs, and exported elements.
- Comments must be precise, technical, and focused on intent and behavior, not on syntax.
- Do NOT explain obvious language constructs (e.g. const declarations, imports, basic assignments).
- Do NOT describe what the code is doing line-by-line.
- Do NOT write tutorial-style, didactic, or learning-oriented explanations.
- Avoid words like "demonstrates", "shows", or "example". Write comments as if this were production code, not a tutorial.
- Only add comments when they add real engineering value.
- Add inline comments only where the logic, intent, or behavior is not immediately obvious.
- If a comment would simply restate the code, do NOT write it.
- High-level explanations belong in README documentation, not in code comments.
- Do NOT change any code.
- Do NOT remove any code.
- Do NOT add unnecessary or redundant comments.
- Return only valid Go code. Do NOT wrap the output in Markdown, code blocks, or backticks.
- Write in clear, professional, production-grade English.

The goal is to make this code understandable to another engineer joining the project.

Here is the code:
